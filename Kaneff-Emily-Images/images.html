			<h3>Reasons For Photo Selections</h3>
			
			<p>The first image shown is that of a bowl of pasta. Now, I love pasta. I could eat pasta every day for the rest of my life and I would never get tired of it. I especially like to play around with different recipes for it whenever I get the chance. The second image I chose was that of a shih tzu puppy. They are my favorite type of dog and I hope to have my own one day. I have one that lives with my mom, but I don't get to see him often. The third image I chose was HTML. Since I am studying to become a web designer, I felt it fit well. The final image I chose was coffe, since as a programmer, it is what keeps me going most of the time. </p>
