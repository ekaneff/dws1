			<h2>Reasons For Site Selections</h2>
			<article>
				<h3>Netflix</h3>
				
				<p>Netflix is one of those applications that you just get lost in. I personally find myself spending a lot of time getting invested in new shows and then eagerly waiting for the new seasons to be released. If you don't know, Netflix is an application where hundreds of shows and movies are available at your disposal for a monthly fee of $10. I spend more time than I should probably be admit on that application. </p>

				<h3>Full Sail FSO</h3>
				
				<p>FSO is the platform that Full Sail University uses for their students and staff. It is where classwork is uploaded and turned in as well as where all the different events going on are found. Since I am a student at Full Sail, I spend loads of time on this site. All of my assignments are given to me through this site and I have to turn them in there as well. </p>

				<h3>Hulu</h3>
				
				<p>Hulu is similar to Netflix but it keeps the shows more updated. For example, episodes of an actively running show appear on Hulu the day after they air on cable, whereas Netflix may take years to get the episodes. I usually only go on this site when I miss an episode of a show I am following and did not record it. </p>

				<h3>Facebook</h3>
				
				<p>If you have not at least heard of Facebook before, you need to stop reading this and google it. Facebook is pretty much known world wide as a social media platform where you can do a variety of different things, such as connect with friends, post photos, make status updates, and play games. I use it mostly to communicate with friends I have in other states that I met in my various moves. </p>

				<h3>Tumblr</h3>
				
				<p>Tumblr is a blogging platform mainly aimed towards young adults. You can write your own posts, favorite other people's posts, follow different blogs, and reblog posts. I find myself on this site when I need something to mindlessly scroll through to kill time or keep my mind occupied. There can be a lot of good content there, but I mainly follow blogs that posts artsy photos, funny memes, or quotes from famous writers. </p>

				<h3>Youtube</h3>
				
				<p>Youtube is a site that is very easy to get lost in. It is a platform for people to upload a variety of different videos on whatever they want, within reason. I like to watch tutorial videos as well as gaming videos by some hilarious people. I used to spend a lot more time on this site than I do now, but it's still a nice change of pace from binge watching Netflix. </p>
