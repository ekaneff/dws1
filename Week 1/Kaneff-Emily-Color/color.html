			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p><strong><em>Gilmore Girls</em></strong> is an American comedy-drama television series created by Amy Sherman-Palladino starring Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel. Sherman-Palladino, her husband, Daniel Palladino, David S. Rosenthal, and Gavin Polone served as the executive producers. The series debuted on October 5, 2000 on The WB to widespread critical acclaim, and remained a tent-pole to the network until its move to The <abbr title="CBS and Warner Brothers">CW</abbr> on September 26, 2006. The series was canceled after its seventh season and ended its run on May 15, 2007.</p>

			<p>The show follows single mother Lorelai Gilmore (Graham) and her daughter, also named Lorelai but who prefers to be called Rory (Bledel), living in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The town is filled with colorful characters and is located approximately 30 minutes from Hartford, Connecticut (as stated in the show's pilot). Ambition, education, work, family, and questions of class constitute some of the series' central concerns. The show's social commentary manifests most clearly in Lorelai's difficult relationship with her wealthy, appearance-obsessed parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore, and in Rory's interactions with the students at the Chilton Academy, and later, Yale University.</p>

			<h3>Premise</h3>
			
			<p>The pilot of Gilmore Girls sets up the premise of the show and a number of its recurrent themes as we learn that Lorelai became pregnant with Rory at age sixteen, but chose not to marry Rory's father, Christopher Hayden. Instead, she leaves her disappointed parents in Hartford, Connecticut, for Stars Hollow. Later episodes reveal that Lorelai and infant Rory were taken in by Mia, owner of the Independence Inn, where Lorelai eventually progressed from maid to executive manager. In the pilot, Rory, who is about to turn sixteen, has been accepted to Chilton Preparatory School in order to pursue her dream of studying at Harvard University. Lorelai finds herself unable to afford Chilton's tuition. Desperation and determination lead Lorelai to approach her parents where she strikes a bargain. Her parents provide her with a loan to cover the tuition in exchange for an agreement that every Friday night she and Rory will join Emily and Richard for dinner at the senior Gilmores'.</p>

			<p>The interaction with Lorelai and her parents foreshadows many conflicts within the series. The mother-daughter relationship of Lorelai-Emily and Lorelai-Rory becomes a defining theme of the show.</p>
