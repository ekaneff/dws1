			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p><strong><em>Gilmore Girls</em></strong> is an American comedy-drama television series created by Amy Sherman-Palladino starring Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel. Sherman-Palladino, her husband, Daniel Palladino, David S. Rosenthal, and Gavin Polone served as the executive producers. The series debuted on October 5, 2000 on The WB to widespread critical acclaim, and remained a tent-pole to the network until its move to The <abbr title="CBS and Warner Brothers">CW</abbr> on September 26, 2006. The series was canceled after its seventh season and ended its run on May 15, 2007.</p>

			<p>The show follows single mother Lorelai Gilmore (Graham) and her daughter, also named Lorelai but who prefers to be called Rory (Bledel), living in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The town is filled with colorful characters and is located approximately 30 minutes from Hartford, Connecticut (as stated in the show's pilot). Ambition, education, work, family, and questions of class constitute some of the series' central concerns. The show's social commentary manifests most clearly in Lorelai's difficult relationship with her wealthy, appearance-obsessed parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore, and in Rory's interactions with the students at the Chilton Academy, and later, Yale University.</p>

			<h2>Episodes</h2>
			
			<h3>Premise</h3>
			
			<p>The pilot of Gilmore Girls sets up the premise of the show and a number of its recurrent themes as we learn that Lorelai became pregnant with Rory at age sixteen, but chose not to marry Rory's father, Christopher Hayden. Instead, she leaves her disappointed parents in Hartford, Connecticut, for Stars Hollow. Later episodes reveal that Lorelai and infant Rory were taken in by Mia, owner of the Independence Inn, where Lorelai eventually progressed from maid to executive manager. In the pilot, Rory, who is about to turn sixteen, has been accepted to Chilton Preparatory School in order to pursue her dream of studying at Harvard University. Lorelai finds herself unable to afford Chilton's tuition. Desperation and determination lead Lorelai to approach her parents where she strikes a bargain. Her parents provide her with a loan to cover the tuition in exchange for an agreement that every Friday night she and Rory will join Emily and Richard for dinner at the senior Gilmores'.</p>

			<p>The interaction with Lorelai and her parents foreshadows many conflicts within the series. The mother-daughter relationship of Lorelai-Emily and Lorelai-Rory becomes a defining theme of the show.</p>

			<h2>Development</h2>
			
			<p>Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show's creator, drew inspiration for the show's setting of "Stars Hollow, Connecticut" after making a trip to Washington, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn, which she found beautiful. She was amazed at how the people of the town knew each other very well and by the next morning of her stay she had written the pilot's dialogue. She explained: "If I can make people feel this much of what I felt walking around this fairy town, I thought that would be wonderful. […] At the time I was there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie. … There was a longing for that in my own life, and I thought—that's something that I would really love to put out there." The show's pace is inspired by Katharine Hepburn–Spencer Tracy films.</p>
			
			<p>The pilot episode of Gilmore Girls received financial support from the script development fund of the Family Friendly Programming Forum, which includes some of the nation's leading advertisers, making it one of the first network shows to reach the air with such funding.</p>
			
			<p>In 2003, the WB planned a spin-off called "Windward Circle," featuring character Jess Mariano, in which Jess gets to know his estranged father, Jimmy (Rob Estes), and befriended by California skateboarders. However, the network canceled the show before it aired, citing high production costs to shoot on location in Venice Beach. Gilmore Girls Season 3 episode "Here Comes the Son" was effectively a backdoor pilot for the unaired spin-off. </p>

			<h2>Writing and Filming</h2>
			
			<p>As signalled by its tagline "Life's short. Talk fast", Gilmore Girls is known for its fast-paced dialogue filled with pop-culture references. Usually a Gilmore Girls script was 77-78 pages long, and one page equaled less than a minute, which allowed the series to include more dialogues and scenes. Much of the dialogue is peppered with references to film, television shows, music, literature and celebrity culture. The relative obscurity of some of these allusions resulted in the production of "Gilmore-isms" booklets included by the WB in the DVD sets of the first four seasons. Subtitled "The 411 on many of the show's witty and memorable wordplays and pop culture references", the booklets also contain comments from the show creators.</p>
			
			<p>Gilmore Girls also relied on a master shot filming style, in which a scene is filmed to frame characters and their dialogue together within a long and uninterrupted, single take; often illustrated through another method regularly employed on the show, the walk and talk. It took up to eight working days to shoot an episode.</p>
			
			<p>The pilot episode was shot in Unionville, Ontario near Toronto while the rest of the series was filmed in Burbank, California at the Warner Bros. lot. The exterior shots of Rory's preparatory school, Chilton, were filmed at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, CA. A special stage was made of plaster and celotex for the scenes during which Rory is at Yale University, which were based on Calhoun College. While Rory's visit to Harvard was filmed at UCLA, her visit at Yale to decide which university she should choose was filmed at Pomona College.</p>

			<h2>Music</h2>
			
			<p>Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino served as the music supervisor of the series. Known for its distinct musical score consisting of melodic "la-la's", Gilmore Girls' non-diegetic score was composed by singer-songwriter Sam Phillips throughout its entire run. For the score's instrumental arrangement, Phillips primarily used her own voice, an acoustic guitar, and on occasion included violin, drums, piano and electric guitar as well. In crafting the sound of the show, Sherman-Palladino requested the music to sound very connected to the girls themselves, almost like "an extension of their thoughts. And if they had music going in their head during a certain emotional thing in their life, if they were real people, this would be the music that was going on." Sherman-Palladino also stresses how "[she] thinks that is what elevated the show. Because [music] wasn’t a wasted element in the show. Everything was trying to say a little something, add a little something to it."</p>
			
			<p>Music also plays a large part in the show as a frequent topic of conversation between characters and in its appearance in scenes themselves.[25] In fact, the first conversation between Lorelai and Rory in the premiere episode, at Luke's Diner, involves the whereabouts of Macy Gray's debut album On How Life Is. The musical tastes of most of the main and recurring characters are revealed at some point, and the two leads have notoriously eclectic but discriminating tastes: Both mother and daughter dislike the "nondescript jazz" played at a baby shower, sculpt a snowman in Björk's image, and proclaim Metallica a "great band". Lorelai famously likes '80s music including the Bangles, XTC, and the Go-Go's, and her old bedroom at her parents' home has Duran Duran posters on the walls. Rory is often shown listening to alternative bands, like Pixies, Sonic Youth, Belle and Sebastian and Franz Ferdinand, and expresses her liking for P J Harvey and distaste for Smashing Pumpkins. Rory also swaps CDs with her mother, and credits her with introducing her to new books and music throughout her life in her address as Chilton's valedictorian.</p>
